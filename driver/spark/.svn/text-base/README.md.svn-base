# Spark-SequoiaDB

Spark-SequoiaDB is a library that allows users to read/write data with [Spark SQL](http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/sql-programming-guide.html) from/into SequoiaDB collections.

[SequoiaDB](http://www.sequoiadb.com/ "SequoiaDB website") is a document-oriented NoSQL database and provides a JSON storage model. [Spark](http://spark.apache.org/ "Spark website") is a fast and general-purpose cluster computing system.

Spark-SequoiaDB library is used to integrate SequoiaDB and Spark, in order to give users a system that combines the advantages of schema-less storage model with dynamic indexing and Spark cluster.

## Requirements

This library requires Spark 1.3+, Scala 2.10.4+ and sequoiadb-driver-1.12

## Using the library

You can link against this library by putting the following lines in your program:
```
<groupId>com.sequoiadb</groupId>
<artifactId>spark-sequoiadb</artifactId>
<version>LATEST</version>
```
You can also download the project separately by doing:
```
git clone https://github.com/SequoiaDB/spark-sequoiadb.git
mvn clean install
```
spark-sequoiadb is built with Scala-2.10 by default. You can use the following command to build with scala-2.11:
```
mvn -Pscala-2.11 package
```
or use the following command to build with all scala versions:
```
sbt/sbt "+ package"
```
You can load the library into spark-shell by using --jars command line option.  
$ bin/spark-shell --jars /Users/sequoiadb/spark-sequoiadb/lib/sequoiadb-driver-1.12.0.jar,/Users/sequoiadb/spark-sequoiadb/target/spark-sequoiadb_2.10-1.12.jar
